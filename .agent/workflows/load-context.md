# Load Context Workflow

**ALWAYS start a new session by reading `docs/active_context.md`.**

## Steps

1. **Read `docs/active_context.md`** — this is the single source of truth for project state.

2. **Summarize to the user**:
   - What the project is (one line)
   - Where we left off
   - The immediate next steps

3. **Ask if they want to continue or do something else.**

## Notes
- Do NOT search around for other files first
- The active_context.md should have everything needed to resume
- If something is missing from active_context.md, add it when saving context
