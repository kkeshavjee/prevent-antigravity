## Introduction
PREVENT is a medical science-generated, digital health initiative to help prevent the early onset of diabetes. The PREVENT program has three phases:
1.  **Phase 1**: An algorithm-based prediction model that uses a person’s electronic health records to identify those at risk.
2.  **Phase 2**: A discussion between a healthcare provider and individual about their health and how best to improve it.
3.  **Phase 3**: The prescribed use of our branded engagement computer app with a software program called **'DAWN'** (aka Shared Decision-Making Tool or SDMT).

### The "DAWN" Concept
The idea of **Dawn** was selected because it evokes a sense of new beginnings. Dawn is a time of hope, denoting the end of night and a time of light and brightness. 

When an individual discovers they are at risk of developing diabetes, they may go into denial or choose to embrace a journey of change. Dawn was selected as the logo and inspiration to help people embrace the information rather than deny it.

The DAWN engagement portal aims to:
- Raise individuals’ expectations.
- Provide a sense of urgency.
- Create a challenge and a positive change environment.

## Goals
- **Long-term Goal**: Build a culture of wellness amongst individuals most at risk of developing Type-2 Diabetes.
- **Short-term Goal**: Increase awareness of potential health factors and offer access to opportunities that build this culture in alignment with individual needs.

### Key Objectives
- **DAWN’s process**: Use community-level effort to inform, act on, and contribute to collective intelligence.
- **Empowerment**: Enable individuals at risk to take concrete actions to improve their health and monitor changes over time.
- **Identity**: DAWN should become "the perfect choice for people like me."

## The Message
The overall message is to inform the audience of their health prediction and alert them to available initiatives to protect their health.

### The Three Main Messages:
1.  **Awareness**: Be aware and become familiar with the influencing factors relevant to your potential for poor diabetes health.
2.  **Proactivity**: Be immediately proactive in your efforts to change this health trajectory.
3.  **Positivity**: This information is nothing to fear; required lifestyle changes can be gradual enough to be enjoyable.

## Distribution
Awareness initially comes from the MD. Access to the DAWN portal is provided through a Nurse, MD, or program-generated letters. 

The DAWN Portal is designed to be similar to a **'curated' shopping mall**, providing easy access to 'storefronts' and easy-to-understand product offerings targeted to individual tastes and needs.

## Evaluation
Attribution evaluation studies will be conducted throughout the development, launch, and post-launch stages. The goal is holistic measurement to understand the impact on lifestyle change generated by these digital communications.
